Fives and Threes Only

Starting with either 3 or 5 and given these operations:
```
    add 5
    multiply by 3
```
You should say if it is possible to reach the target number n.
Examples```

only_5_and_3(14) ➞ True
# 14 = 3*3 + 5

only_5_and_3(25) ➞ True
# 25 = 5+5+5+5+5

only_5_and_3(7) ➞ False
# There exists no path to the target number 7
```
